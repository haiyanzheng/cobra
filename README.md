# COBRA

This repository contains R functions needed to compute the effective sample size of the generalised gamma priors, which are specified using historical control data from the PHOTO trial.

For reproducing the levels of power and error rate (including those that incorporate the historical controls) reported, please refer to the R script named 'COBRA_HZ2'.
Line 98 and onwards are the command needed.
